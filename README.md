  * You lack technical confidence to move from concept to product.  
* **Point B:**  
  * You graduate with a **validated AI startup concept**, tested with real feedback (The Mom Test, JTBD).  
  * You understand how to **navigate the ecosystem**, pitch clearly, and position your idea for incubators/accelerators.  
  * You have your **first traction strategy** (beta users, waitlists, referral hacks).  
  * You know how to **use Hakim AI** for emotional mentoring, financial clarity, and daily founder guidance.  
  * You gain **hands-on coding experience with 4Geeks Vive Coding**, and leave with a **working AI prototype (MVP)** you can show to investors or early users.
